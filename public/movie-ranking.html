<p>This is my best movie of all time. I have watched it many times and each time feels like a different experience. 
This movie is one of best in genre viz. sci-fi, adventure, thriller and mystery.    
</p>
<h3>2. One Piece Animated series</h3>

<p>This is one of the best animated series and the author behind the manga is a true
genius. The amount of imagination put behind this story is out of this world.    
</p>
<h3>3. Hunter x Hunter Animated series</h3>

<p>This is yet another animated series like one piece but it has different type of vibe 
to it. This has more intense action scenes which gives literal goosebumps.

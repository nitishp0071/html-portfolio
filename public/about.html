<h2>About Me</h2>

  driven by my passion for technology and continuous learning.

  I am currently focused on building strong foundational skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, 
  with the aim of becoming a full-stack web developer. I am particularly interested in developing clean, 
  user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems.
